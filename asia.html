      <div class="asia-content">
        <p class="asia-description">
          The Yeren (whose name translates to wildman) is a large, aplelike hominid, reportedly standing over 6 feet tall and covered in reddish brown hair from head to toe.
        </p>
        <p class="asia-legend">
          Potential Yeren sightings date back as far as 3rd and 4th century BC, though modern interest peaked in the 1950’s and 60’s. Reports about the Yeren’s temperament vary. In some stories the Yeren is described as docile and peaceful towards humans, while in others it is savage and violent, attacking villages and eating livestock (and sometimes kidnapping humans too).
        </p>
        <div class="circle"></div>
        <p class="asia-info">In recent years, the Yeren has become a symbol for environmental conservation and draws tourists to Shennongjia National Park, where they can try to catch a glimpse of the elusive wildman themselves.</p>

      <div class="asia-content">
        <p class="asia-description">
          The Kappa is a reptilian humanoid that inhabits the rivers and streams of Japan. With a turtle-like appearance, the Kappa’s power comes from water that is kept in an indentation on their skulls. If this water is poured out, a Kappa loses its supernatural abilities. 
        <p class="asia-legend">
          Kappas are said to be knowledgeable in medicine, and to have taught humans the art of setting broken bones. 
        </p>
        </p>
        <div class="circle"></div>
        <p class="asia-info">While often depicted as mischievous and somewhat friendly to humans, some legends paint the Kappa as extremely dangerous, with a penchant for devouring unlucky swimmers in their rivers.</p>
        <p class="asia-infoExtra">Kappa fall into the category of a kami, or divine spirit, in Japanese mythology, and are often left offerings of cucumbers, as this is their favorite food.</p>
