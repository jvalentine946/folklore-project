## Final Project

### Project Summary

Our project is about folklore from around the world. We decided on this topic because we wanted to cover a variety of stories from a variety of places, partly to be inclusive and partly to distinguish our project since many other groups in the course chose folklore as their topic. Choosing to do a regional project rather than a single piece of folklore also gives us as a group more material to pull from, making it easier to make 10+ distinct webpages.

### Key Takeaways

Our main goal was to explore folklore from various cultures to create an inclusive and diverse collection of stories. Instead of focusing on just one tale, we decided on a regional approach, which allows us to cover a wider range of folklore and make our project stand out from others in the course.

One of the biggest advantages of this approach is that it gives us flexibility, each group member can contribute their own research on different cultures, ensuring we have enough material to build at least 10 unique webpages. This also helps us create a more engaging user experience, as visitors can explore stories from different regions through an interactive world map.

From a documentation perspective, this project also emphasizes teamwork and organization. Each member has a clear role, and we’ve used structured planning to ensure the site is well-designed, informative, and visually appealing. The design choices, including color schemes and layout inspirations, reflect our goal of making the information both accessible and engaging.

Ultimately, this project is about more than just folklore, it’s about understanding cultural heritage and storytelling traditions in a way that resonates with a modern audience.

### Core Webpages

Here is our core pages (bound to update) :

Home - This page will have a world map with different pin points. Each pin point will feature different folklore/tales and clicking on it will expand the information

About us - This will explain the team, our goals, and values

Folklore Pages - These pages will explain the history of each individual tale with each having their own page dedicated to them. Information will include images, history, and present day effects.
