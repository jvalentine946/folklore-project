## Final Project

### Project Summary

Our project is about folklore from around the world. We decided on this topic because we wanted to cover a variety of stories from a variety of places, partly to be inclusive and partly to distinguish our project since many other groups in the course chose folklore as their topic. Choosing to do a regional project rather than a single piece of folklore also gives us as a group more material to pull from, making it easier to make 10+ distinct webpages.
