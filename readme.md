## Final Project

### Project Summary

Our project is about folklore from around the world. We decided on this topic because we wanted to cover a variety of stories from a variety of places, partly to be inclusive and partly to distinguish our project since many other groups in the course chose folklore as their topic. Choosing to do a regional project rather than a single piece of folklore also gives us as a group more material to pull from, making it easier to make 10+ distinct webpages.

### Core Webpages

Here is our core pages (bound to update) :

Home - This page will have a world map with different pin points. Each pin point will feature different folklore/tales and clicking on it will expand the information

About us - This will explain the team, our goals, and values

Folklore Pages - These pages will explain the history of each individual tale with each having their own page dedicated to them. Information will include images, history, and present day effects.
