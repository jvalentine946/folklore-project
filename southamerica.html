        <p class="ocean-description">
          El Duende is a creature created by Latin Americans who believe this
          elf/goblin creature actually exists and lures in Mexico’s forests and
          caves. El Duende is believed to be evil and good for its reasons. It
          is also heard that it can take the shape of older people or helpless
          people and requires help/assistance.
        </p>
        <p class="ocean-legend">
          There is no exact origin of El Duende but they seem to be mistaken for
          spider monkeys or howler monkeys, even though the size matching
          wouldn’t connect. El Duendes’ are accused of kidnapping small children
          and bringing them to temples hidden deep in forests. Others believe
          that they protect lost hikers, lost children, and animals of the
          forests.

          <p>
            Their existence has yet to be proven and there is no speculation of
            this creature being real, but folks in Latin America believe El
            Duende is very real and very serious. Whether El Duende is a
            protector or evil, if you hear one whistle, it’s best you get as far
            as you can in whatever forest you stumbled upon before you get lost
            for good.
          </p>

        <p class="southamerica-infoExtra">
          El Duendes' height is around three to four feet tall, and is believed
          to be part of the primate species. It has heavy shoulders, long arms
          and long hair from the neck and back. They are typically seen wearing
          big hats and look like small humans.
