            Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is a humanlike, large, and hair
            creature believed to exist in the northwestern United States. This
            creature represents the North American counterpart to other
            creatures known as the Abominable Snowman or Yeti. Bigfoot’s origin
            comes from the British explorer, David Thompson, when he found
            footprints of the creature in 1811.

            Later in 1924, the legend began to grow as five gold miners were
            attacked by “large gorilla” creatures and fought back. During the
            night the creatures returned and attacked their living quarters, the
            miners then fled in the morning. These claims were then discredited
            by US forest rangers who proved the footprints were fake. Since then
            throughout the years there have been sightings of Bigfoot and
            alleged photography of the creature. Nothing has yet been verified
            but only contributes to the legend of Bigfoot.

            The name Bigfoot comes from its rather large feet, the typical
            length is 24 inches by 8 inches wide. This 24 inches is over twice
            the size of a man’s average foot. The name Bigfoot comes from its
